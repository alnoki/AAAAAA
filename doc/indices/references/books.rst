      From :ref:`book-checklist-manifesto`:

      ..

         Here, then, is our situation at the start of the twenty-first century:
         We have accumulated stupendous know-how. We have put it in the hands
         of some of the most highly trained, highly skilled, and hardworking
         people in our society. And, with it, they have indeed accomplished
         extraordinary things. Nonetheless, that know-how is often
         unmanageable. Avoidable failures are common and persistent, not to
         mention demoralizing and frustrating, across many fields - from
         medicine to finance, business to government. And the reason is
         increasingly evident: the volume and complexity of what we need to
         know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits
         correctly, safely, or reliably. Knowledge has both saved us and
         burdened us.

         That means we need a different strategy for overcoming failure, one
         that builds on experience and takes advantage of the knowledge people
         have but somehow also makes up for our inevitable human inadequacies.
         And there is such a strategy - though it will seem almost ridiculous
         in its simplicity, maybe even crazy to those of us who have spent
         years carefully developing ever more advanced skills and technologies.

         It is a checklist.
