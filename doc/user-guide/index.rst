.. tip::
   Keep on hitting the :guilabel:`Next` button at the top or the bottom of the
   page!

   It will allow you to sequentially visit every page in :term:`AAAAAA`
   documentation in a logical order

Unfortunately, if you are using a :xref:`mobile device <mobile-device>` to view
this :xref:`website <website>`, you might not be able to see all of the
:ref:`concepts-code-e4` :(
