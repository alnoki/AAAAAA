If you haven't already taken a look at the :ref:`examples <examples>`
section, which showcases select :term:`AAAAAA` functionality, you may want to
start there

This guide explains, with more depth than the
:ref:`examples <examples>` section, the various :ref:`tools-python` and
:wiki-pg:`finance <Finance>` concepts associated with :term:`AAAAAA`, while
presenting a closer look at the :xref:`source code <source-code>`. You do not
need any background knowledge on :xref:`Python` or
:wiki-pg:`software <Software>` in general, as this guide is designed to teach
you all that you need to know in order to use :term:`AAAAAA`. Concepts are
presented in a logical sequence (as long as you keep
:wiki-pg:`clicking <Point_and_click>` :guilabel:`Next`!) that is designed to
be self-contained, but if you want more resources there a few select ones below

   logical order
