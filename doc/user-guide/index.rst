If you haven't already taken a look at the :ref:`examples <examples>`
section, which showcases select :term:`AAAAAA` functionality, you may want to
start there

This guide explains, with more depth than the

:wiki-pg:`finance <Finance>` concepts associated with :term:`AAAAAA`, while
presenting a closer look at the :xref:`source code <source-code>`

.. tip::
   Keep on hitting the :guilabel:`Next` button at the top or the bottom of the
   :xref:`webpage <webpage>`!

   It will allow you to sequentially visit every :xref:`webpage <webpage>` in
   :term:`AAAAAA` documentation in a logical order
