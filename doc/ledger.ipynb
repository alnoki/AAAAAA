    "# The Transaction class\n",
    "## Main components of a transaction\n",
    "A transaction constitutes the fundamental component of a quantitative trading architecture. A transaction can be defined as an object with the following attributes:\n",
    "1. Date\n",
    "2. Ticker symbol\n",
    "3. Number of shares\n",
    "4. Total transaction amount\n",
    "5. Transaction type\n",
    "6. Description\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional implications\n",
    "The following considerations will be discussed later:\n",
    "1. The per share amount in a transaction can be derived from the total transaction amount and the number of shares\n",
    "2. A ticker symbol does not always have to be associated with a transaction. This behavior is present in a bank transfer of cash into or out of a brokerage account\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the transaction class\n",
    "Assume first that the initialized transaction contains no actual information. This is a defensive coding practice that motivates the use of the None as the default value for all attributes. The expected data type of each of the class attributes is included as a comment, and because the datetime.date class is needed, the datetime library is imported"
