**************************
How alnoki's apps are made
**************************

The :ref:`environment setup <dev-env-intro>` will help you
:wiki-pg:`install <Installation_(computer_programs)>` the
:ref:`tools <concepts-tools>` and :ref:`configurations <concepts-configs>`
that :github:`alnoki` uses to create :term:`AAAAAA`

The :ref:`concepts section <concepts-intro>` provides conside conceptual
explanations of the :ref:`tools <concepts-tools>` and
:ref:`configurations <concepts-configs>` that :github:`alnoki` uses to create
:term:`AAAAAA`, and the specific ways that they are used

The :ref:`distributing section <dist-intro>` contains detailed explanations to
guide you through distributing your :ref:`documentation <dist-doc>` and
(*coming soon*) more

The :ref:`testing section <testing-intro>` is *coming soon*

The :ref:`procedures section <procedures>` contains :term:`checklist`-like
instructions for common :wiki-pg:`development <Software_development>` tasks,
like :ref:`managing references with Sphinx <sphinx-managing-references>`

.. tip::

   Keep on :wiki-pg:`clicking <Point_and_click>` the :guilabel:`Next` button
   at the top or the bottom of the :xref:`webpage <webpage>`! It will allow you
   to sequentially visit all :xref:`webpages <webpage>` of
   :wiki-pg:`documentation <Software_documentation>` for :term:`AAAAAA`
   in a logical order

**********************************
How you can make something similar
**********************************

Everything you should need to know about how :term:`AAAAAA` are
:wiki-pg:`developed <Software_development>` is explained in the following
sections, but if you are just looking for some quick information on starting
your own :ref:`tools-sphinx`-style :wiki-pg:`website <Website>`, which you can
indeed have :wiki-pg:`hosted <Host_(network)>` for :wiki-pg:`free <Money>`,
some select :wiki-pg:`links <URL>` are below

   :ref:`Documentation <dist-doc>`, Guide to :ref:`distributing <dist-intro>`

Of course there are a few things you will need to figure out along the way, but
:wiki-pg:`documentation <Software_documentation>` for :term:`AAAAAA` can help
with that. And don't forget, there's always :ref:`tools-google`
