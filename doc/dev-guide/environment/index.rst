The steps in this section will enable you to reproduce the environment that
:xref:`alnoki <alnoki-repos>` uses to create :term:`AAAAAA`

Before you begin, you will need
:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`, which will
give you access to :xref:`Python` and :xref:`Anaconda`. If you participated in
the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart>`, then you should already have
:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`

Any configurations, settings, and :ref:`tools <concepts-tools>` that you might
need are described in the following instructions, so get ready to install some
:xref:`free software <open-source>`!

After the installation, there are some
:ref:`conceptual descriptions <concepts>` that should explain all of the
:xref:`software <software>` and familiarize you with developing :term:`AAAAAA`

.. tip::
   Keep on hitting the :guilabel:`Next` button at the top or the bottom of the
   page!

   It will allow you to sequentially visit every page in :term:`AAAAAA`
   documentation in a logical order
