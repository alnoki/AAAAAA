Environment setup
#################

The steps in this section will enable you to reproduce the environment that
:github:`alnoki` uses to create :term:`AAAAAA`

Before you begin, you will need
:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`, which will
give you access to :xref:`Python` and :xref:`Anaconda`. If you participated in
the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart>`, then you should already have
:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`

Any configurations, settings, and :ref:`tools <concepts-tools>` that you might
need are described in the following instructions, so get ready to
:wiki-pg:`install <Installation_(computer_programs)>` some
:xref:`free software <open-source>`!
