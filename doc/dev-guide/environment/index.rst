Environment setup
#################

The steps in this section will enable you to reproduce the
:wiki-pg:`integrated development environment
<Integrated_development_environment>` that :github:`alnoki` uses to create
:term:`AAAAAA`, which will all be explained afterwards in the
:ref:`concepts <concepts-intro>` section

Before you begin, you will need
:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`, which will
give you access to :xref:`Python` and :xref:`Anaconda`. If you participated in
the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart>`, then you should already have
:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`

Any :ref:`tools <concepts-tools>` and :ref:`configurations <concepts-configs>`
that you might need will be :wiki-pg:`downloaded <Download>` throughout the
following instructions, so get ready to
:wiki-pg:`install <Installation_(computer_programs)>` some
:wiki-pg:`free software <Open-source_software>`!
