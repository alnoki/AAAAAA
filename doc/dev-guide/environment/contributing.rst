The :ref:`Git configuring procedures <git-configuring>` will help you get
started, and the rest of the :ref:`Git procedures <procedures-git>` describe
some common :wiki-pg:`development <Software_development>` tasks that enable
:wiki-pg:`online <Internet>` collaboration

Make sure to follow :xref:`Git commit guidelines <git-commit-guidelines>`, and
review the :ref:`Tools: Git <tools-git>` section if you want more information


***
Vim
***

To maximize efficiency,
:vs-code-ext:`install the Vim extension <vscodevim.vim>` for
:ref:`tools-vs-code`. If you have never used it before, the
:ref:`Tools: Vim <tools-vim>` section has plenty of references that can help
you learn. If you like :wiki-pg:`keyboard shortcuts <Keyboard_shortcut>`, then
you may like :ref:`tools-vim`
