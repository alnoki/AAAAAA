For developers

The steps in this section will enable you to reproduce the environment that
:xref:`alnoki <alnoki-repos>` uses to create :term:`AAAAAA`

Before you begin, you will need
:std:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`, which will
give you access to :xref:`Python` and :xref:`Anaconda`. If you participated in
the :ref:`quickstart`, then you should already have it!

Any configurations, tools, or settings that you might need are described
throughout the following setup instructions, so get ready to install some free
software!
