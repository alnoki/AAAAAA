The steps in this section will enable you to reproduce the environment that
:xref:`alnoki <alnoki-repos>` uses to create :term:`AAAAAA`, which is
completely :xref:`open-source`

Before you begin, you will need
:std:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`, which will
give you access to :xref:`Python` and :xref:`Anaconda`. If you participated in
the :ref:`quickstart`, then you should already have
:std:doc:`Miniconda <conda:user-guide/install/download>`

Any configurations, settings, and tools that you might need are described
in the following instructions, so get ready to install some free software!

Following the installation are some :ref:`conceptual explanations <concepts>`
that will explain all the software and familiarize you with developing
:term:`AAAAAA`

.. tip::

   Keep on hitting the :guilabel:`Next` button at the top or the bottom of the
   page!

   It will allow you to sequentially visit every page in :term:`AAAAAA`
   documentation in a logical order
