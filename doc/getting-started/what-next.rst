:ref:`link <references-links>`, for a :xref:`webpage <webpage>` from somewhere
like :xref:`Python.org <Python>`, :wiki-pg:`Wikipedia`, or :xref:`YouTube`.
Typically this information is accompanied by a conceptual explanation that fits

:wiki-pg:`open-source <Open-source_software>` world of :xref:`Python`. Indeed,
you shall learn that which you need as you follow the

this :xref:`website <website>` is made with :ref:`tools-sphinx` and as such you
can view every :xref:`webpage <webpage>` in a logical linear order without
having to think twice (if you use :guilabel:`next`)

Otherwise, keep reading!

:github:`alnoki <alnoki>` uses, head over to the
:ref:`developer guide <dev-intro>`
