All the software tools used to create the AAAAAA are open source:

* `The Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ is used to manage all of the Python packages in the AAAAAA
* `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ is used to create tests for the AAAAAA source code
* `Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_ are used for interactive development documentation
* `Read the Dox with Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_ is used to document code via `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (``reST``)

    * This documentation is built using the `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

* `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_ is the preferred integrated development environment used to edit code and documentation. Extensions used:
