Alnoki's Inspired Philosophies, Adopted and Implemented in Practice (AIP)^2
***************************************************************************

#. Silly acronyms actually help with remembering things
#. Testing and documenting up front prevents runtime debug headaches
#. Have DRY (don't repeat yourself) [#]_ code: decompose as much as possible
#. Documentation should enable another to re-write source and test code [#]_
#. Have STUPID simple tests. [#]_ Don't recursively 'test the test code'
#. Documenting & testing adds perspective beyond source code development alone
#. Consider :xref:`DO-178B` as a model for software design assurance [#]_
#. :pep:`8` provides a repeatable and official means for formatting
#. Legacy conventions shant prevent the adoption of a new worthwhile philosopy
#. Play around and "whiteboard" code during initial stages [#]_
#. Read documentation out loud [#]_
