***********************************************************
Alnoki's Inspired Philosophies, Adopted in Practice (AIP)^2
***********************************************************

#. Silly acronyms actually help with remembering things
#. Testing and documenting up front prevents runtime debug headaches
#. Have DRY (don't repeat yourself) code: decompose as much as possible
#. Documentation should enable another to re-write source and test code
#. Have STUPID simple tests. [1]_ Don't recursively 'test the test code'
#. Documenting & testing forces consideration from various perspectives
#. Consider DO-178B as a model for software design assurance
#. :pep:`8` provides a repeatable and official means for formatting
#. Legacy conventions shouldn't prevent a new worthwhile philosophy
#. Play around and "whiteboard" code during initial stages
#. Read documentation out loud [2]_
