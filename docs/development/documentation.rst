***************
Sphinx and reST
***************

Documentation is written primarily according to the `Python Developer's Guide <https://devguide.python.org/documenting/#documenting-python>`_
and secondarily according to:
`Style guide for Sphinx-based documentations <https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_

Thus, 3 spaces are used for indentation and sections ``H1`` and ``H2`` are
preceded by two blank lines

Jupyter Notebooks

`Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_ are used for some analyses, and
notebooks for AAAAAA can be accessed
`here <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alnoki/AAAAAA/tree/master/nbs/>`_.
References to specific notebooks should be found throughout
AAAAAA documentation, but the above link is for the highest-level notebook
