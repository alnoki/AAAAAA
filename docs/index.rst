Python?
*******
A bit of Python can be executed on most computers with minimal effort, using
:py:func:`print`:

1. Open the command line on your specific machine

  * ``Terminal`` on a Mac
  * ``Command Prompt`` on Windows
  * If using Linux, you probably already know where to look...

2. Type ``python`` and hit ``enter``
3. Copy and paste the below contents to the command line and hit ``enter``::

    print("I am a computer programmer!")

4. If you are feeling fancy (hit ``enter`` twice for this one)::

    for i in range(5):
        print("Please be aware of the number", i)

Congratulations!!!
